Similarity in author names: Some author names may appear similar or have variations (e.g., Onyx Anam vs. Oni Axel), which can lead to confusion and overlap between lists.\n3. Lack of exclusivity: Some authors may be included in both lists without any clear reason, which can contribute to the moderate amount of overlap observed.\n\nIn conclusion, while there is a moderate amount of overlap between List 1 and List 2, there are also many unique authors in each list that do not appear in the other.']

Verhoef, Ellen\n\nThese 6 authors are present in both lists, which means there is an overlap of 60% (or 6 out of 10). However, since there are only 6 common authors between the two lists, the overall overlap is lower at 75%.\n\nJustification: To calculate the overlap, we need to divide the number of common authors by the total number of authors in List 1. In this case, the total number of authors in List 1 is 8 (Bødker, Susanne; Kaptelinin, Vera; Monroe, Mark; Nardi, Bonnie; Shneiderman, Ben; Verhoef, Ellen).

Out of the 9 authors listed in List 1, only Susanne Bødker and Vera Kaptelinin are not present in List 2. This means that 70% of the authors in List 1 also appear in List 2.\n\nThe overlap is likely due to the fact that both lists include well-known researchers in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).
