It covers fundamental data structures such as stacks, queues, sets, maps, and heaps, along with advanced topics like lock-free data structures, atomic snapshots, and multiword locks. The authors present a variety of techniques for constructing concurrent data structures that can be used to build robust, high-performance concurrent programs. This book is intended for computer science students, researchers, and practitioners who are interested in understanding the principles of concurrent programming and designing efficient concurrent data structures.",H
